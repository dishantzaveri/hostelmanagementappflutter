"Hostel Management System"  -> A Hostel management system is a system designed to manage all hostel related activities like hostel admissions, fees, room, mess allotment, hostel stores & generates related reports for smooth transactions. It is also used to manage monthly mess bill calculation, hostel staff payroll, student certificates, etc. The hostel management system was created to automate the hostel's functions. The goal of the hostel management system is to efficiently carry out hostel activities. The system will assist staff in saving student records, determining which rooms are vacant, billing/ordering in the mess, online hostel fee payments,attendance and timing information for each student, as well as their room numbers and hostel details, making it almost effortless for wardens to run hostels. This system will also assist in keeping track of new and existing students' records.
The goal of creating this system is to automate manual labour and make it a bit less tedious.
